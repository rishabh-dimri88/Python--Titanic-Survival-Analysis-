# Good number of males in 3rd class in comparison to females.

# Will be more interesting to see the split between children, male and female.

**Interesting, quite a bit of children in 3rd class and not so many in 1st!** 

# Lets do the distribution of the ages to get a precise picture of the who the passengers.

# let's see using kernel density plots.

# where did the passenger come from

Q shows almost every passengers in 3rd class. Interesting to know the economics of this town during that era.

# With family or alone distribution

** factors affecting the survival**

# Shows that children and females from any class had better survival chance
# than males. Being a male or being a 3rd class was definitely not favorable
# for survival

# General trend if we look a the linear line, the older the passenger was, the less likely they survived

# higher standard deviation on older people in the first class. Older people
# in first class were tried to be saved

# Wow interesting! 
# looks like older females had better chance of survival than older males

# Looks like alone females had better chance of survival than females with large families. Males with large families had more or less same chance of survival which is very less.
